## üß© Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the world's leading causes of death.  
This project applies machine learning algorithms to clinical features in order to predict whether an individual has heart disease.

---

## üìà Dataset

The dataset used is the [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease).

- **Number of samples**: 303
- **Target**: `target` (1 = heart disease present, 0 = no heart disease)

## üîç EDA and Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**: No missing values detected.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Heatmaps to visualize feature correlations
  - Pairplots for initial patterns
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Label encoding for categorical variables
  - Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
  - Data splitting into training and test sets (80/20 split)

---

## ü§ñ Modeling

The following machine learning models were trained and evaluated:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

**Additional Techniques:**

- Hyperparameter Tuning:
  - GridSearchCV
  - KNN optimization with best `k` search
- Cross-Validation for robust model evaluation

---

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:

- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

---

## üèÜ Results

| Model               | Accuracy |
| :------------------ | :------- |
| Logistic Regression | ~85%     |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | ~84%     |
| Decision Tree       | ~79%     |
| Random Forest       | ~87%     |
| SVM                 | ~82%     |
| XGBoost             | ~88%     |

‚úÖ **XGBoost Classifier achieved the best performance overall**.
